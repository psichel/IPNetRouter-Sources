<HTML><HEAD>   <TITLE>Read Me</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H1>Read Me About MoreNetworkSetup</H1><P>1.0b1</P><P>Mac OS 8.5 introduced a new programming interface, Network Setup,that allows you to programmatically configure the network interfaceson the machine (AppleTalk, TCP/IP, Remote Access, etc). This sampleincludes two source code libraries which provide simplified access toNetwork Setup. The first, <STRONG>MoreNetworkSetup</STRONG>, is asimple wrapper around Network Setup. The second,<STRONG>NetworkSetupHelpers</STRONG>, provides high-levelfunctionality (for example, turning AppleTalk on/off, switchingTCP/IP configurations) that works with both Network Setup and onpre-Mac OS 8.5 systems.</P><P>The MoreNetworkSetup library requires the Network Setup Extension(which is installed by Mac OS 8.5 and above). NetworkSetupHelpersworks with both Mac OS 8.5 (using the Network Setup programminginterface) and older systems (using a previously undocumentedprogramming interface). NetworkSetupHelpers requires Open Transport1.1.1 or higher.</P><H2>Packing List</H2><P>The sample contains the following items:</P><UL>   <LI>ReadMe.html -- This document.      <LI>MoreNetworkSetup.h -- Interface to the MoreNetworkSetup   library.      <LI>MoreNetworkSetup.c -- Source code for the above.      <LI>NetworkSetupHelpers.h -- Interface to the NetworkSetupHelpers   library.      <LI>NetworkSetupHelpers.c -- Source code for the above.      <LI>NetworkSetupTest -- A program which tests NetworkSetupHelpers,   and hence MoreNetworkSetup.      <LI>Network Setup SDK Bits -- A pre-release copy of the Network   Setup SDK.      <LI>OldStyleAPI -- Interfaces and libraries to access the old, not   supported on Mac OS 8.5 and above, mechanism for changing OT   configurations.</UL><H2>Using the Sample</H2><P>To use this sample, open the "NetworkSetupTest" folder and launchthe NetworkSetupTest appliation. You can then choose whether you'reinterested in AppleTalk or TCP/IP. Choose a protocol by entering thecorresponding letter. The program then displays a list ofconfigurations for that protocol. You can switch to a newconfiguration by entering the letter for that configuration.</P><P>In addition, the sample demonstrates the followingprotocol-specific features:</P><UL>   <LI>If you choose TCP/IP, the sample will let you know whether   opening a TCP/IP endpoint will cause the modem to dial.      <LI>If you choose AppleTalk, the sample will let you know whether   AppleTalk is active or inactive. In addition, when switich to a   configuration, you can enter "0" to disable AppleTalk or "1" to   enable it.</UL><H2>Building the Sample</H2><P>The sample was built using the standard MoreIsBetter buildenvironment (CodeWarrior Pro 2 compiler with Universal Interfaces3.2). You should be able to build the project in Code Warrior Pro 4without difficulty. To build the project, open the"NetworkSetupTest.mcp" project file inside the "NetworkSetupTest"folder, select the "Fat" target, and choose Make from the Projectmenu. This will build NetworkSetupTest-68K, NetworkSetupTest-PPC, andNetworkSetupTest.</P><H2>About the Libraries</H2><H3>MoreNetworkSetup</H3><P>MoreNetworkSetup is a simple layer on top of Network Setup.Because of its history, Network Setup is somewhat more complex thatit needs to be. MoreNetworkSetup reduces that complexity.</P><P>One way MoreNetworkSetup reduces complexity is that it allocatesmemory for you. Network Setup never allocates memory and returns itto you. It's an entirely pointer-based programming interface. Thismakes sense for a system library which may be used in a variety ofcontexts. MoreNetworkSetup can relax this restriction because we giveyou the source code. If you need to change the memory allocator(currently the Mac OS Memory Manager's <CODE>NewPtr</CODE> and<CODE>DisposePtr</CODE>), just go in there and change it.</P><P>To understand MoreNetworkSetup, you'll probably need a high-leveloverview of Network Setup itself. The documentation for Network Setupis still in progress, although the "NetworkSetupBigPicture.html"</P><H3>NetworkSetupHelpers</H3><P>The philosophy behind NetworkSetupHelpers is that it shouldprovide a high-level abstraction to commonly needed features ofNetwork Setup. It should also provide that abstraction on both Mac OS8.5 (where Network Setup is installed) and older systems (through apreviously undocumented API).</P><H2>Caveats</H2><P>The Network Setup programming interface is only available toPowerPC code.  If the Network Setup library is available, you shouldalways use it in preference to whatever old mechanism you're using. Therefore, if you base code on this sample, you must ensure that itruns as PowerPC code on PowerPC computers.</P><P>One possible workaround to this is to call the Network Setupprogramming interface from your 68K code via Mixed Mode.  While thisis possible, this sample doesn't include the relevant glue.  If yourun a 68K build of this code on a machine with Network Setupinstalled, it will detect that case and return an error.</P><H2>Credits and Version History</H2><P>If you find any problems with this sample, mail&lt;DTS@apple.com&gt; with "Attn: Quinn" as the first line of yourmail and I'll try to fix them up.</P><P>1.0b1 (Nov 1998) was the first released version. It's based on anumber of other samples that use Network Setup, includingOTTCPWillDial and SwitchTCP.</P><P>Share and Enjoy.</P><P>Quinn "The Eskimo!"<BR>Apple Developer Technical Support<BR>Networking, Communications, Hardware</P><P>10 Nov 1998</P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
