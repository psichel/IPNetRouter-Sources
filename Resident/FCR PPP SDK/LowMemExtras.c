/* There is a problem with the InterfaceLib in the PPC ROMs documented in * PLAT 27 - Missing Low Memory Globals * Question: *	 I am getting a link error on my PowerPC application when I use the  *	following low memory globals: * *		LMGetHighHeapMark *		LMGetROMMapHandle *		LMGetStackLowPoint *		LMGetUnitTableEntryCount *		LMSetHighHeapMark *		LMSetROMMapHandle *		LMSetStackLowPoint *		LMSetUnitTableEntryCount  * *	What is wrong? Is there a workaround?  * * Unfortunately, these globals didn't make it into the Interface library on  * PowerPC machines. This problem was discovered after InterfaceLib was frozen and  * in ROM. We are aware of the problem and it has been reported as a bug.   * The problem is that InterfaceLib is in ROM, so it's not as simple as  * shipping a new replacement library. * * There is no good solution, but there is a workaround: * * Create an external function in a file (say Extra.c) to access the low-mem  * yourself (from native code only), as shown below. When an updated  * library is released, you only have to remove the Extra.c.o file from your  * link command and relink your app, not recompile it. */#if defined(powerc) || defined (__powerc)pascal short LMGetUnitTableEntryCount();pascal short LMGetUnitTableEntryCount(){    //return *(short *)0x01D2;    short* dp;    dp = 0x01D2;	return *dp;}#endif
